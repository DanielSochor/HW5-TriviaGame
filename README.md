Trivia Game using jQuery and Timers

This project is a Trivia Game that uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The javascript is broken into one file for the game and one for the questions which allows each to be adjusted independently. The game:

* Starts with beautifully styled CSS that creates a calming feeling 

* Provides a question for the user to answer

* Each question is randomly selected and the answers are randomly positioned

* The user has a set time to answer each question. If they fail to answer the question or answer it incorrectly the correct answer is shown for a few seconds. If correct it provides the next question

* The CSS provides instant feedback of correctness based off the color of the button

* The final page gives the user their result and offers the chance to play again. Good thing the questions and answers shuffle!

We hope you enjoy this game!
